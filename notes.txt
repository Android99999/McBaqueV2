tokens

Here's a suggested learning path to dive deeper into each topic:

Start with OAuth:

Read OAuth 2.0 documentation and tutorials to understand the basics.
Implement OAuth authentication in a sample application using a popular OAuth provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
Next, focus on Tokens:

Learn about different types of tokens and their purposes.
Implement token-based authentication in your application using access tokens and refresh tokens.
Then, move on to JWT:

Study JWT specifications and best practices.
Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization in your application.
Explore libraries and frameworks that support JWT authentication (e.g., Passport.js for Node.js).
Finally, learn about localStorage:

Experiment with storing and retrieving data using localStorage in a simple web application.
Explore advanced localStorage features, such as managing storage limits, handling data expiration, and synchronizing data across browser tabs.
